## 🚀 What is Snippetor?

Snippetor is a powerful and privacy-first VS Code extension that allows you to capture and share **Software Architecture Snippets**. Think of it as a way to leave breadcrumbs of your knowledge and design decisions directly within your codebase.

Instead of writing long, disconnected documents, a snippet is a sequence of notes tied to specific files and line numbers. This makes it easy to:

  * **Document internal logic** and complex architecture.
  * **Onboard new team members** by guiding them through the codebase.
  * **Share technical understanding** with colleagues.
  * **Create a personal knowledge base** for future reference.

### 📋 What is a Snippet?

A snippet is a collection of one or more items, each consisting of:

  * **`filename`**: The file where the note is located.
  * **`line number`**: The specific line of code.
  * **`note`**: Your comment or explanation.

Together, these items describe the flow, design decisions, or internal logic of a piece of code. This structured format helps document key insights in a clear and contextual way.

## 📁 Where is Your Data Stored?

Your data is always yours. Snippetor is designed with a **privacy-first** philosophy, which means no data is ever sent to a remote server.

By default, the extension creates your snippet data in a local folder:

`~/.vscode/archsnippets/`

You have full control over your storage location and can use shared folders for collaboration, such as:

  * A **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** folder
  * A **synced Git repository** (recommended for teams\!)

This flexibility allows you to choose your own backend and storage method, making collaboration seamless and secure without relying on any external service.

## 🛠 Features

  * **Auto-creates and manages local snippet spaces:** Get started instantly without any configuration.
  * **Supports organizing snippets into folders:** Keep your knowledge base tidy and easy to navigate.
  * **Lightweight and privacy-first:** No telemetry, no remote servers, no usage data collected.
  * **Shareable data:** Easily share snippet folders with your team.
